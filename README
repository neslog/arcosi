ArcOSI is the leading Open Source Threat Intelligence tool for ArcSight ESM.  


It work's by scraping websites for malicious Domains or IP's and then forwards them to an ArcSight Syslog Smart Connector in CEF format.

You can simply run it as is with lots of default intel sources, just point it to your Syslogd: ./arcosi.py <syslog ip>

Specify a custom port?  Easy, ./arcosi.py -p <custom port> <syslog ip>

How about supply your own threat intelligence sites with IP or Domain names?  Supply a config file (like the one supplied)  ./arcosi.py -c arcosi.cfg <syslog ip>

We also have a single exe version for Windows!

Thanks and please let us know your feedback.
